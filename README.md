# SARSA Implementation for Cliff Walking Problem

This repository contains a Python implementation of the SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action) on-policy algorithm applied to the classic Cliff Walking Problem.

## Overview

The SARSA algorithm is a reinforcement learning method used to learn the optimal policy for sequential decision-making tasks. In this project, SARSA is applied to the Cliff Walking Problem, a classic gridworld environment where an agent must navigate through a grid while avoiding falling off a cliff to reach a goal state.

## Implementation Details

- The Python implementation of SARSA is provided in the `sarsa_cliff_walking.py` file.
- The Cliff Walking Problem environment is defined within the script.
- The SARSA algorithm is implemented to learn the optimal policy for navigating the gridworld while avoiding the cliff.
- Visualization code may be included to visualize the SARSA learning progress and the learned policy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib (for visualization, if included)

## Usage

To run the SARSA implementation for the Cliff Walking Problem:
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the `sarsa_cliff_walking.py` script using Python:
   4. Optionally, visualize the SARSA learning progress and the learned policy.
